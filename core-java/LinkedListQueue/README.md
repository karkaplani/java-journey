# Linked List Queue
An implementation of a custom data structure, Linked List Queue inheriting from Queue and the iterator for it. In the first phase, JUnit5 test cases were written to test the normal, edge and error cases for each of the methods, and then the actual implementation was made.

# Outcomes
- Creating a data structure using algorithms
- Writing JUnit test cases
- Test-driven development (Although not an application)
