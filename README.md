# Great Java Journey
Hey there! This repository sums up the relationship between me and my first love, Java throughout a year. There are two parts of the repository each consists of 4 projects, which  each will be briefly explained with a link to the actual code and demonstration. As a note, **the toy projects are excluded**, so there shall not be seen anything like a calculator, or a tic-tac-toe game.

## Background
Back in May 2020, when I first started programming in Algonquin College I have met with Java after an email from my very first professor Leanne Seaward telling to start programming a little in advance using W3Schools and an [online compiler](https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/). Since that time when I first output the sum of two numbers and felt like I can do anything from this point, I have been trying to achieve that fascinating feeling again by making projects. The first study term was about programming in general, and the second one was focusing on Object-Oriented Programming with Java. At the end of that term, which is also the time I stepped on to Canada, I started making these projects. Most of them are academic projects that gave me A+ in all the Java courses.

Greetings to my amazing teachers; Leanne Seaward, Shahriar Emami aka Shawn, Teddy Yap and Stack Overflow.

## Core Java Module
The four projects of the Core Java  Module focuses mostly on Java and core programming rather than making a soup with a million different technologies. 

### [1. Apo Sunk](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/core-java/ApoSunk)
Text-based game to practice core programming concepts

- Exception handling, pure programming, game flow

### [2. Revenge of Prometheus](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/core-java/RevengeOfPrometheus)
Console/Desktop game to fully understand OOP and JavaFX

- OOP, iteration algorithms, JavaFX, drawing diagrams

### [3. Linked List Queue](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/core-java/LinkedListQueue)
Implementation and testing of a custom data structure

 - Data structures, test-driven development

### [4. Thread Counter](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/core-java/ThreadCounter)
Desktop app as an asynchronously working stopwatch

- Threading in Java

## Advance Java Module
Here is where the things get ugly with different technologies from Maven to Payara servers. All the projects were made in the second year Java classes (OOP with Design Patterns, Enterprise Application Programming). The RDBMS used for the projects is MySQL.

### [1. Database Reader](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/advance-java/DBReader)
The very first desktop application to read records from a database

- MVC, JavaFX, JDBC, Maven

### [2. Blood Bank (Servlet Version)](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/advance-java/BloodBank-Servlet)
A web application to work with blood data running on Apache-Tomcat server

- DAO, JSP, Servlets, team colaboration

### [3. Data Bank](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/advance-java/DataBank)
Another web application running on Payara server for CRUD operations on a person data

 - JPA, EJB, Bootstrap

### [4. Blood Bank (REST Version)](https://github.com/karkaplani/java-journey/tree/main/advance-java/BloodBank-REST)
Tested REST service with security for a web application

- Jackson, JPQL, Session Beans, JUnit
