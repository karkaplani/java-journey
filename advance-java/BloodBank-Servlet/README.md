# Blood Bank - Servlet
The first Web application developed in Java as the final assignment of OOP with Design Patterns (aka JavaIII) course. A lot of concepts are covered in this project including unit testing and servlets. The application and the diagrams were made in a team of four including myself with Harpal Choudhary, Marthe Julie Dubuisson and Adam Plater-Zyberk. 

The application is running on an Apache Tomcat server with a MySQL database connection. The user is able to read the records from one of the 4 tables as well as to create new records either for each table standalone, or to all the tables at once by using the Blood Donation Form.

# Outcomes
- Implementing DAO design pattern
- Using both Servlets and JSP
- Running a Java app on server
- JUnit testing
- Colaborating with a team on a complex project

# Video Demo

**Important Note: The video is taken by Shahriar Emami since NetBeans-Tomcat setup does not exist anymore on my machine when I created this repository. The project though looks pretty much the same.**
