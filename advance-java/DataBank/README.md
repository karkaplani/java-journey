# Data Bank
An Enterprise Java(J2EE) web application implementing CRUD operations using EJB and JPA concepts for data persistence, and JSF and Bootstrap for the view component. The app has a MySQL connection, and runs on Payara server. Form validation, and transactional locking used to prevent overriding.

The purpose of the application is to give user an ability to read, update, delete an existing person as well to add a new person to the database easily. Perhaps the prettiest project among all Java projects. 

# Outcomes
- Using JPA object relational mapping framework
- Writing EJBs (Enterprise Java Bean)
- Using Bootstrap
- Running an app on Payara server
- Practicing transactional locking
