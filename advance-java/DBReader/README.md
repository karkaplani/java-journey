# Database Reader
The first approach to desktop app development with Java. MVC design pattern is practiced, which the view of the application was mostly implemented by Professor Shahriar Emmami, and model/controller components are implemented by me using JDBC in order to refactor the base app. 

The application is aiming to simply connect to a MySQL database and read the data of several reddit links according to the table selected by the user. 

# Outcomes
- MVC design pattern
- Refactoring an existing application
- Using JavaFX for desktop GUI
- Writing pure JDBC code 
- Drawing sequence diagrams
- Using Maven to build a project
