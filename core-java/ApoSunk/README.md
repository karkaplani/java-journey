# Apo Sunk
Fleet Battle-like console game made to personally practice core programming concepts. The same project was done once after the first study term with a terribly DRY code, and refactored again after the second term with a better grasp on Java and programming in general. 

# Gameplay
The player is prompted to enter the coordinates on the given map to place 10 ships, and the computer's logical ships are placed to the random coordinates. When the battle starts, user can select a coordinate on the table to shoot, and then the computer makes its choice. The game continues till one side's all ships are destroyed. User is not allowed to make the same choice, or make an inappropriate choice The user's ships are represented by '@', and the locations shot are by 'X'.

# Outcomes
- Using methods efficiently
- Core concepts (decision making, iteration, Input-Output)
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Exception handling
- Game flow
