# Revenge of Prometheus
Old school text adventure game made to fully understand Object-Oriented Programming as well as to practice more on core programming and game flow. The UML diagram of the program and a flowchart for the mob runs are provided. See the src/game/RevengeOfPrometheus.java file for the actual gameplay code for the console. Gameplay.java is for the desktop version with a GUI.

# Story
The story provides an alternative scenario to the Greek titan Prometheus, which was chained to a mountain by Zeus since he was trying to steal the fire from Zeus to help humanity. Later, Zeus' son Heracles saves Prometheus during his quest. In this game, Prometheus wants to take a revenge from Zeus,and at this time his another son Hermes is helping out Prometheus in his adventure. In overall, we all hate terrible fathers like Zeus.

# Gameplay
The user is provided to choose a class of either Tank with a greater health and armour, or Fighter with the reversed stats. After that, there are 3 types of mobs generated randomly to face with the user. When the user encounters a mob, she can either start or avoid fighting, which will earn user CP(Cowardness Point) When a fight starts, user can choose one of the options of attack, drink a pot (If there is any), and use a special attack which consumes the user's own health. After each battle, there's a possibility for a mob to drop a pot determined by the class of the mob. 

After a particular amount of mobs beaten, the user encounters with a weapon dealer, and she can choose one of the 3 choices, which simply increases one of the stats of the user, if there is not much CP earned earlier. After one more mob run, user encounters with another creature which will give user a chance to earn additional health if the question is answered correctly. 

Lastly, the final boss fight starts against Zeus, who has the ability to heal himself in every 3 rounds, and also his damage increases when he goes into the 'rage mode' when his health goes under a critical amount. 

The user sees one of the four different scenarios in the end; when she dies to a mob, when she beats Zeus and finishes the game, when she can't beat Zeus and seek for mercy, and don't seek for mercy. 

# Outcomes
- Full grasp on OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation, Interfaces)
- Writing complex iteration algorithms
- Drawing UML diagrams and flowcharts
- Practicing story telling
- Keeping track of all different numbers and using math to fine tune the gameplay
- Using JavaFX to create a desktop app

# Second Version
The console app was tried to be made right after the first study term, but it didn't go well. After the second term, which the OOP was studied, there were good amount of time spend on merely thinking and designing the game, story and the algorithms, so that it could be done in few days. 

During the first weeks of the third term, where the approach to GUI apps with JavaFX was made, the game was tried to be refactored with a desktop GUI to learn and practice more JavaFX. Although the desktop version is successfully functioning, I don't consider it to be a completed project since I didn't implement a proper design. I tried to add some design using CSS, but it went horrible, so I decided to drop the desktop project.
